  patient_id: "HIPAA-compliant format"
  facility_id: "CMS certification number"
```

### Date Fields

Date handling requires special attention in healthcare:

```yaml
dates:
  date_of_birth: "YYYY-MM-DD with age validation"
  service_date: "YYYY-MM-DD with business rules"
  effective_date: "YYYY-MM-DD with status tracking"
```

### Code Fields

Healthcare codes must follow industry standards:

```yaml
codes:
  diagnosis: "ICD-10-CM"
  procedure: "CPT/HCPCS"
  medication: "RxNorm"
  lab: "LOINC"
```

## Mapping Rules

2. **Location Management**
   - Handle multiple addresses
   - Define service areas
   - Map to provider coverage
   - Support facility hierarchies

## Privacy and Security

### PHI Protection

Protected Health Information (PHI) requires:

1. **Field Identification**

   - Mark PHI fields
   - Define access levels
   - Implement encryption
   - Enable audit logging

2. **Data Handling**
   - Secure transmission
   - Proper storage
   - Access control
   - Retention policies

### Sensitive Information

Special categories requiring extra protection:

1. **Mental Health**

   - Separate consent tracking
   - Special access controls
   - Note segmentation
   - Release tracking

2. **Substance Abuse**
   - 42 CFR Part 2 compliance

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setup Process

1. **Configuration**

   ```python
   from config import healthcare_rules

   # Load domain-specific rules
   rules = healthcare_rules.load_rules()

   # Initialize context handlers
   provider_context = HealthcareContext('provider')
   patient_context = HealthcareContext('patient')
   facility_context = HealthcareContext('facility')
   ```

2. **Rule Application**

   ```python
   # Apply rules during mapping
   def map_healthcare_field(source_field, target_field, context):
       # Get domain-specific rules
       domain_rules = rules.get_rules(context)

       # Apply field type rules
       field_type = domain_rules.get_field_type(source_field)
       validation = field_type.validate(source_field.value)

       # Apply mapping rules
       mapping = domain_rules.apply_mapping_rules(
           source_field,
           target_field,
           validation
       )

       # Enhance with context
       enhanced_mapping = context.enhance_mapping(mapping)

       return enhanced_mapping
   ```

3. **Privacy Handling**
   ```python
   # Handle PHI fields
   def process_phi_field(field, context):
       if field.is_phi():
           # Apply encryption
           field.encrypt()

           # Log access
           context.log_phi_access(field)

           # Apply special handling
           field.apply_phi_rules()
   ```
